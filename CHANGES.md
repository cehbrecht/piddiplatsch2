# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Plugins: Namespace CMIP6 configuration under `[plugins.cmip6]` and switch to a static plugin registry (single active plugin selected via `consumer.processor`).
### Documentation
- Streamlined README: concise Testing section, compact Recovery/Retry, removed duplicates.
- Added explicit smoke test note: run `make test-smoke` for local end-to-end.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-22
### Added
- Run retry via `RetryRunner` class with `run_file` and `run_batch`.
- Common result module at `piddiplatsch.result` consolidating dataclasses.
- Common helpers at `piddiplatsch.helpers`: `DailyJsonlWriter`, `read_jsonl`, `find_jsonl`, `utc_now`.
- JSONL handle backend now uses shared helpers (daily rotation, UTC timestamps).
- Retry CLI supports files/dirs/globs, skipped items, `--dry-run`, `--delete-after`, and `-v`.
- New `--force` option to continue despite transient external failures (records skipped items).

### Changed
- Unified persistence API: `RecorderBase.record()` handles infos and writes to JSONL files.
- Retry logic migrated to class-based `persist/retry`.
- Standardized timestamps to UTC via `utc_now()`.
- Simplified logging and persistence flows.
